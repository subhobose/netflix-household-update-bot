# netflix-household-update-bot

Bot to avoid doing that annoying household update yourself. This bot checks your email (gmail in this regard) periodically, and confirms household updates, if any. 
Pre-req:
1. Download packages in package.json (dependencies)
2. Follow GMAIL API setup documentation and have the following 2 files ready: credentials.json, token.json(generated when authenticated the first time)

Run using node index.js. Cheers!

Note: Run times can vary
